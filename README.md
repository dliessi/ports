Personal MacPorts Portfile repository

*****
**Do you want to install Frescobaldi on Mac OS X? Please read [INSTALL-Frescobaldi.md](INSTALL-Frescobaldi.md).**
*****

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for information about how to use this repository.

**N.B.** Branches other than `master` can be subject to **history rewriting**, so use them at your own risk.

Available Portfiles:
* [frescobaldi](http://www.frescobaldi.org/) @2.0.11
* frescobaldi-devel @20131126
* [py-python-poppler-qt4](https://code.google.com/p/python-poppler-qt4/) @0.16.3

I should keep these Portfiles reasonably up to date with newly released versions.
Iâ€™ll update frescobaldi-devel as soon as I notice that a new feature is completed or a bug is fixed.
If time passes and I do not upgrade the Portfiles, please open a new issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/dliessi/ports/issues).
