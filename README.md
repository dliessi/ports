**Do you want to install Frescobaldi on Mac OS X? Please read [the instructions in Frescobaldi’s wiki](https://github.com/wbsoft/frescobaldi/wiki/How-to-install-Frescobaldi-on-Mac-OS-X).**

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for information about how to use this repository.

**N.B.** Branches other than `master` can be subject to **history rewriting**, so use them at your own risk.

Available Portfiles:
* [frescobaldi](http://www.frescobaldi.org/) @2.17.2
* frescobaldi-devel @20150117
* [py-ly](https://github.com/wbsoft/python-ly) @0.8
* [py-poppler-qt4](https://github.com/wbsoft/python-poppler-qt4) @0.18.2

I should keep these Portfiles reasonably up to date with newly released versions.
I’ll update frescobaldi-devel as soon as I notice that a new feature is completed or a bug is fixed.
If time passes and I do not upgrade the Portfiles, please open a new issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/dliessi/ports/issues).
