This was my personal MacPorts Portfile repository.
Now all my Portfile development happens in a fork of the [official MacPorts Git repository](https://github.com/macports/macports-ports).

If you were using my repository and you want to get rid of references to it on your system, you can remove your local clone of this repository (`/opt/dliessi` in the recommended instructions) and delete the corresponding line from your MacPorts installation's `sources.conf` file.
